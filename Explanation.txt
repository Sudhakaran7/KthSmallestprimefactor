You are given with a sorted list A which contain 1 and some other prime numbers, Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.
you are given with a k, find the kth fraction of the array.

Input Description:
First line contains, n and k, n is the size of the array and k is the target we have to find fraction
Second line contains, n elements of prime numbers (1<n,k<1000)

Output Description:
Kth smallest fraction
